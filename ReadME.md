# v4cHelper

Mozilla Firefox Addon to enhance [CyTube](https://github.com/calzoneman/sync). 
- Makes emotes in chat clickable (pastes them into text chat on click).
- Tracks emotes that were sent recently in a small dialog window. These are then also clickable.
- Can help to apply effects to the chat more easily (Select and apply in dialog window).

Tested on cytu.be/r/v4c but probably works in any room.
